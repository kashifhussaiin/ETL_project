# ETL Project

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python and PostgreSQL. The project includes a dataset, a Jupyter notebook with the ETL script, and a requirements file for dependencies.

## Project Structure

```
ETL_project/
├── data/
│   └── dataset.csv          # The dataset used in the ETL process
├── notebook/
│   └── ETL.ipynb            # Jupyter notebook with the ETL script
└── requirements.txt         # Dependencies required for the project
```

## Dataset

- **Path**: `data/dataset.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset used in this project for the ETL process.

## Jupyter Notebook

- **Path**: `notebook/ETL.ipynb`
- **Description**: The Jupyter notebook contains the entire ETL script. This notebook demonstrates how data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into a PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

- **Path**: `requirements.txt`
- **Description**: This file contains all the Python dependencies required to run the ETL script. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ETL_project.git
   cd ETL_project
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a new database:

     ```sh
     psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE etl_db;"
     ```

4. **Configure the database connection**:

   - Update the database configuration in the `ETL.ipynb` notebook with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### Running the ETL Process

1. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebook/ETL.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**:

   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell. The notebook will guide you through the ETL process, from extracting data from the CSV file to loading it into the PostgreSQL database.
